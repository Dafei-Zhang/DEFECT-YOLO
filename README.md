# DEFECT-YOLO: Enhanced Metal Surface Defect Detection

## Overview
DEFECT-YOLO is an advanced model designed to enhance the detection of metal surface defects by addressing challenges such as inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Based on the YOLOv8s model, DEFECT-YOLO introduces several key enhancements to improve accuracy and efficiency in multi-metal defect detection.

## Innovations
- **Effective Multi-scale Downsampling Convolution Module (EMDCM):** Enhances detection accuracy while keeping parameters minimal.
- **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with Efficient Multiscale Attention (ASPPE):** Improves the model's capability to capture local features.
- **Multi-branch Coordinate Attention (MCA):** Strengthens feature extraction for more precise defect detection.
- **Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) Loss Function:** Integrates localization and Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) losses to better detect small target defects.

## Performance
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5):** Achieves a 3.6% improvement over baseline models.
- **Parameter Increase:** Only 1.64M additional parameters.
- **Inference Speed:** Meets real-time detection requirements for industrial applications.

## Getting Started

### Prepare Dataset

#### Dataset Source
The DEFECT dataset is curated from the following sources:
- **Aluminum Defect Dataset**
- **Magnetic Tile Surface Defects Dataset**
- **GC-DET Dataset**
- **NEU-DET Dataset**

The dataset includes common defect categories, with corrections made by field experts to address incorrect labels, remove poor-quality samples, and annotate previously unlabelled data.

#### Dataset Distribution
The distribution of defect categories in the DEFECT dataset is illustrated below:

#### Distribution Analysis
To investigate the distribution of the center point coordinates of the instance box and the width and height distribution of the instance box in the DEFECT-DET dataset, corresponding charts were generated:

- **Center Point Coordinates Distribution:**
  - The area above and near the center on the x-axis had darker colors, indicating that labels were predominantly located at the center of the images. Other labels were scattered in various positions.

- **Width and Height Distribution of the Instance Box:**
  - The distribution is mainly concentrated in the bottom-left corner, suggesting that most defects in this dataset are small targets. As the aspect ratio of labels increased, the number of defects gradually decreased, indicating a lower prevalence of large-sized targets. Some labels were concentrated near the end of the coordinate axes, indicating the existence of extremely wide and tall labels.
