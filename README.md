# DEFECT-YOLO: Enhanced Metal Surface Defect Detection

## Overview
DEFECT-YOLO is an advanced model designed to improve the detection of metal surface defects, addressing the challenges posed by inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Based on the YOLOv8s model, DEFECT-YOLO introduces several enhancements to boost accuracy and efficiency in multi-metal defect detection.

## Key Features
- **Effective Multi-scale Downsampling Convolution Module (EMDCM):** Improves detection accuracy while minimizing parameters.
- **Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with Efficient Multiscale Attention (ASPPE):** Enhances the model's ability to capture local information.
- **Multi-branch Coordinate Attention (MCA):** Strengthens feature extraction for defects.
- **Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) Loss Function:** Combines localization and Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) losses for better detection of small target defects.

## Performance
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5):** Achieves a 3.6% improvement over baseline models.
- **Parameter Increase:** Only 1.64M additional parameters.
- **Inference Speed:** Meets real-time detection requirements for industrial applications.
